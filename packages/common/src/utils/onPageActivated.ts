/**
 * Pre-rendering causes some issues with the way the extension
 * communicates with dApps. Namely, when the page is first pre-rendered,
 * content scripts are injected before the page is activated
 * by the user. Then when the user finally activates it, the connection
 * gets lost.
 *
 * This util is useful for only running certain actions after the page
 * has been activated by the user. This ensures that the connection
 * remains active.
