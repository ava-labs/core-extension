     * in case there was some interruption in getting the response
     * back from Fireblocks.
     *
     * For example: user is on a train, submits the transaction and
     * enters a tunnel, losing connection.
     *
     * We will receive an error in the response (i.e. request timed out),
     * but in reality it could have succeeded - but we have no way of
     * knowing what the result was.
     *
     * I was thinking about using a hash of the transaction payload +
     * the request timestamp as the external TX id. Then, if the request
     * fails for unknown reasons, we could store both the hash and the
     * timestamp locally.
     *
     * Later on, if we see the user repeating the same transaction within
     * a given timeframe, we can fetch ID of the previous, possibly successful
     * transaction from Fireblocks and check what the result was by calling
     * the API endpoint:
     *
     *   /transactions/external_tx_id/:externalTxId/
     *
     * If such a transaction exists and was submitted sucessfully, we could
     * warn the user that they're about to send an identical transaction.
     *
     * If such a transaction does not exist, or was not submitted successfully,
     * we'd let the user submit the new one without interruptions.
     *
     * For now, just generate a random UUID.
     * TODO: make it not random before going to prod (not critical, but good to have).
